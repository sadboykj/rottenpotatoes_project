mocha
- test runner

chai
- assertion library
- syntactic sugar - makes writing tests better.

chai-http
- helper test library
- methods for making http requests in tests

Schema
[Learning Schema Types](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/schematypes.html)
- def: a representation of a plan or theory in the form of an outline or model
- organization or structure for a database
- data modeling
- types:
    - String, Number (min, max), Date, Boolean, Array
    - Buffer: holds binary data
        - Uses: basic authentication, hex colors
    - Mixed: Anything goes; mongoose does no casting
    - ObjectId: fits the type of the ObjectId from handlebars import
    - Map:
        - [Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map)
        - Seems similar to a dictionary
        - holds key-value pairs
